# User- defined Function to Create a `ggplot2` plot

## 25.04.2023

If we need to apply a specific code to multiple segments of data, we may resort to duplicating and pasting the code. However, this approach is risky as it may introduce interdependencies within the code. Moreover, overlooking the need to modify the replicated code could lead to errors that are difficult to identify promptly.

As a result, I will demonstrate in this R markdown how we can generate a ggplot2 plot using a user-defined function. To illustrate this concept, I will use the penguins dataset from the palmerpenguins R package.
